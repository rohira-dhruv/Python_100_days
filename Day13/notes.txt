Debugging

1.  Test all your assumptions that you have taken for the code. Generally one of them is false and has introduced an error.
2.  Reproduce the bug. keep reusing parts of code and check if they are faulty.
3.  Look at the errors highlighted by the editor and the console.
4.  Debugging is something you get good at with experience. The more bugs we get rid of, the more knowledgeable we become.
5.  Use print statements to check where your code goes bad.
6.  Lastly, use a debugger. PythonTutor is a good online tool. Thonny is one good offline tool. Use breakpoints to check status of all variables at that instance.
7.  Take a break. Sometimes simple bugs are not so apparent.
8.  Ask a friend. Gets a set of fresh eyes to look at your code.
9.  Run your code often. That is, write after the slightest changes so that the bugs don't pile up.
10. Use StackOverflow.
