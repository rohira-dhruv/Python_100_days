Object Oriented Programming

// Split a lot of tasks into several reusable pieces.
// Model something: take two parts - what it has (attributes) and what it does (functions/methods)
// Class is a blueprint of the model from which you can create multiple objects having those attributes and methods.
// Class names are in Pascal Case.
// car = Car()
